## Essential Information

The 2018 PyCon Australia Python in Education Seminar will be held on Friday
August 24th in Sydney, Australia, at the
[International Convention Center, Sydney](https://www.iccsydney.com.au).

* The main conference CFP (including proposals for the Education Seminar)
  has now closed. We look forward to sharing our list of selected presentations
  with you after the review and selection process is complete!
* Applications to be part of the Student Showcase have also closed. We have
  received some truly excellent submissions, and reviewers are currently
  working through those and will be notifying successful applicants soon.

## Seminar Overview

Python is both a simple and consistent language for beginners and a powerful
real-world language used in industry.
This combination is why it's a popular language in education: it's a great way
to start for beginner programmers who are beyond graphical programming environments
like Scratch and reaching the limitations of 'toy' languages.

The Python in Education seminar aims to bring together Python educators to share
ideas and resources. Come along to hear how Python is used to teach programming
in school classrooms and extracurricular clubs and camps around Australia.
This is a time to share resources and experiences and to bring up any setbacks
to a group of people keen and ready to help out.

If you're new to Python, this is a great opportunity to see what it can do, how
it works in an educational environment and build up your own skills and confidence.

## Submitting a talk or other proposal for the 2019 Education Seminar

While applications for the 2018 Education Seminar have closed, we're planning to
submit a specialist track proposal again for 2019, so if there's something you'd
like to present to a mixed audience of teachers and technologists, make a note of
it, and consider submitting a proposal next year!

## Submitting a project presentation for the Student Showcase

While applications for the 2018 Student Showcase have closed, we're aiming to have
it return in 2019, so there will hopefully be more opportunities to participate
in the future!

## Format

The Python in Education Seminar runs each year at the start of PyCon Australia, in
parallel with a number of other specialist events. In 2018, the Python in Education
Seminar will take place on Friday the 24th of August.

For the morning and post-lunch sessions, the talk schedule will be aligned with
the other PyCon specialist tracks that are running simultaneously to make it
easy for attendees that choose to do so to attend parts of each of them.

For the first time in 2018, the post-afternoon-tea session at the Education
Seminar will feature a dedicated Student Showcase, an opportunity for students
in Years 7-12 to give short presentations regarding projects they have been
working on in Python, including ways in which Python has helped (and perhaps
hindered!) their efforts.

## Audience

All are welcome to attend the Python in Education Seminar! For selected
presenters, the kind of audience to expect includes:

- Primary and secondary school teachers
