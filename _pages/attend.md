### Location

All of PyCon AU will be held at the [International Convention
Center](https://www.iccsydney.com.au/about-icc-sydney), in Sydney's Darling
Harbour. We'll be using the Cockle Bay room for our full-conference
presentations, and other rooms on Level 3 for our tracks. 

The venue will have digital signage directing attendees to the conference. 

#### Getting to ICC

From Central Station take:
 * a light-rail tram to Convention Center. Upon arrival from Central, the ICC will be on your right.
 * a train to Town Hall, then walk ~15 minutes downhill (west on Druitt St), contining towards Cockle Bay/Darling Harbour. A lift/staircase will take you down to the harbour, and we are across the bay

On the Friday, Saturday and Sunday, morning tea, lunch, and afternoon tea will be provided for attendees. Those who have indicated dietary requirements will be catered for by the venue with special meals. 

Only morning and afternoon tea will be catered for the Development Sprints. Lunch can be acquired at many local restaurants, or the food court at Harbourside shopping centre. 


### Venue Map

There will be signage and ushers on the ground level directing you to the escalators to Level 3. We will be holding the opening and closing day events in the Cockle Bay room, and tracks in the rooms around this area.

Childcare will be in room C4.2, on Level 4, which is accessible via the lifts near the Quiet Room (C3.1). 

The Quiet Room in C3.1 is a designated quiet space. Please use this room for quiet activity. We ask you do not have loud conversations, or take phone calls, in this space. 


As well as our [schedule](/schedule), the digital signs in front of each room will display the talks to be held in that room.
