### Location

All of PyCon AU will be held at the [International Convention
Center](https://www.iccsydney.com.au/about-icc-sydney), in Sydney's Darling
Harbour. We'll be using the Cockle Bay room for our full-conference
presentations, and other rooms on Level 3 for our tracks. 

The venue will have digital signage directing attendees to the conference. 


### Financial assistance

Thanks to the support of our sponsors, we have budget set aside for providing financial assistance for people who might otherwise find it difficult to attend PyCon AU. See the [financial assistance page](/assistance/) for more details about the selection process and the application form.
### Ticket Tiers

We want everyone to be able to attend our conference, regardless of financial ability. 

See [Ticket Tiers](/attend/ticket-tiers)


### Shirts

Every year PyCon AU produces a stylish Monty Python-themed t-shirt for attendees, the design is revealed at the conference. It's always a sought-after item to let people know that you attended PyCon AU.

See [Shirts](/attend/shirts)

### Accomodation

Although it sometimes doesn't seem like it, sleep is an important part of any multi-day conference.
