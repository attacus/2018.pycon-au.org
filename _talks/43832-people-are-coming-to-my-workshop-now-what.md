Volunteers often love running programming tutorial/workshops. Weâ€™ll look at how to make your tutorial/workshop more accessible for attendees and tips that help them stay relaxed and learn effectively. The talk incorporates what I learned as a teacher and includes a new source of help in revising material. While this talk will be focusing on making your tutorial  accessible to beginners, however, the tips given can be applied to tutorials/workshops of all levels.

We will be covering optimizing the presentation of tutorials/workshops, language used, tips for when you have more attendees than you know how to handle, tips for conference organizers, and tips for attendees.
