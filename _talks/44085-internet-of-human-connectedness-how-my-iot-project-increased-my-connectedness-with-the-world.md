abstract: My talk is about my first IoT project. I changed careers to become a software
  developer but I was curious about hardware so I taught myself by way of a passion
  project involving sensors and a shoe. The talk will cover my inspiration and what
  I learned (re tech but also about myself).
---
I'm a career changer who wanted to learn about hardware but didn't know where to start. After trawling the internet for inspiration, I found it in my non-tech love: [withheld as it may indicate gender]. This talk takes you through the initial struggles of figuring out how to start, learning to ask for help (the how and what), the project itself, and what I learned about myself along the way. 

My IoT journey has also had the unexpected benefit of igniting the interests of the non-tech people in my life and has helped to address the disconnect I had felt with the people from my pre-tech life. Who knew that attaching a sensor to a shoe could do all that?
