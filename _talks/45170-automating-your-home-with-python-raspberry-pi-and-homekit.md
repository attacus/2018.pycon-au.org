abstract: It's forty degrees and you're on your way home in the sweltering Australian
  heat. Home awaits but it too has been baking in the sun all day. That's okay, though!
  You open your iPhone, tap a button and your air conditioner whirs into action, powered
  by your Python code and your trusty Raspberry Pi.

Home Automation is a fun new field for the modern Pythonista. In this talk I will be walking through how a developer can leverage a python library to use the HomeKit service and automate the devices in their home. I will be covering topics like hardware selection for local and remote access, HomeKit service registration and management and potential security concerns around IoT.
