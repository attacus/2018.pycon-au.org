abstract: 'A Phileas Fogg inspired tour of 8 frameworks


  "Had he programmed? It was likely, for no one seemed to know web frameworks more
  familiarly; there was no framework so obscure that he did not appear to have an
  intimate acquaintance with it. He must have developed in everything, at least in
  the spirit."'

Join us for a Phileas Fogg inspired whirlwind tour of eight Python Web Frameworks.

"Had he programmed? It was likely, for no one seemed to know web frameworks more familiarly; there was no framework so obscure that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it. He must have developed in everything, at least in the spirit."

We'll start with the current crop of microframeworks, showing how to achieve the same task in each, before progressing to "Batteries included" and then the more specialised async frameworks. For developers who perhaps have only used a single framework or even none at all, this talk gives them an opportunity to get out and explore the world (of web frameworks) and broaden their horizons, with plenty of Jules Verne inspired fun along the way.
