abstract: Python is widely used in embedded applications due to its simplicity. Raspberry
  pi (pi came from the Python!) and Beagle Bone which are commonly used in embedded
  applications are  programmed using Python and run on Debian Linux platform.

Since Python is an open source programming language, it can be easily modified and used according to our own purpose.It creates a wide usage of Python in embedded area.Embedded boards such as Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone are programmed using Python and run on Linux Debian platform.Raspian is one of the widely used Linux platform on Raspberry Pi.The talk would be about the support provided by Python and Debian for embedded application.
