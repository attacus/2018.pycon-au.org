abstract: Have you often wondered where the quietest spot in the office is right now?
  In this talk, we explain how we built a real-time system that does just that using
  CircuitPython.

Workplace indoor environment quality is highly correlated with workplace satisfaction. Yet the measure of whatâ€™s good varies from person to person. In this talk, we discuss the process of developing a system which provides visibility over these factors.  

The basic outline of the talk is the:
- Hardware needed for such a system e.g Adafruit circuit playground express
- Use of CircuitPython for firmware development (covering its history, and how it differs from microPython)
- Tradeoffs of CircuitPython (easy learning curve and good for education but not good for use in production)
- Code Walkthrough/demo
- A demo of the system which shows us the spatial distribution of sound, light, and temperature levels in a workplace
