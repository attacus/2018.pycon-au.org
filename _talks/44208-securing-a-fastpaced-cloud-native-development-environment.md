- bio: 'Aagam is just a small kid with relevant skills and passion to make the world
    a better place. He was awarded with scholarship from Google for Udacity''s Android
    Developer Nanodegree, which allowed him to boast himself as an Android Developer.
    But life had his own plans, he found his interest in Data Science and tried a
    few projects, which eventually landed him at Red Hat in Fabric 8 Analytics team.
    Right now, his day usually involves solving problems which are a mix of Software
    Engineering and Data Science. '

abstract: In this talk we will see how the Openshift.io team over came the challenges
  and combined the power of different vulnerability scanners to make the platform
  more secure and production ready, all done and delivered in an elegant open-source
  manner!

Securing an application from vulnerabilities is never easy and what's more tough is to have a process that makes the system know of those vulnerabilities in the first place. In this talk, we will go through a concrete example of securing openshift.io that can help you understand the nuts and bolts involved in the process. 

We will hopefully walk through the following (in no specific order):  
- What kind of vulnerabilities can arise while dealing with micro-services and containers.  
- Categorize those vulnerabilities according to the scope.   
- How to deal with such vulnerabilities in a Pythonic way?  
- Challenges faced while developing an open source solution to tackle vulnerabilities.  
- How to leverage the power of existing open source tools and encourage community to contribute.  
- Possible future roadmap and how to develop machine learning models to make vulnerability detection process more robust.

The topics covered above will give you an overall idea as to how to deal with arising vulnerabilities and how to develop a process that takes care of them. We will also walk through concrete examples in Python and possibly some tools for each topic and that can prove as a starting point for your journey towards making your application more secure.
