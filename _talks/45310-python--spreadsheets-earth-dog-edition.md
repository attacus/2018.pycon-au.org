- bio: "Kojo Idrissa *was* an accountant who got an MBA and taught at university in\
    \ two different countries. He's *now* a new(ish) software engineer. Besides his\
    \ family and friends, he likes teaching, helping new contributors join tech communities,\
    \ inclusion, Python, Django, and many aspects of east Asian culture (\u6B66\u4FE0\
    \u5C0F\u8AAA, \u6F2B\u753B, \uD55C\uB958). He's spoken at tech conferences about\
    \ what new software engineers need to know, spreadsheets, contributing to tech\
    \ communities, Dungeons & Dragons, inclusion and privilege. You can find him online\
    \ at http://kojoidrissa.com/ or as [@transition](https://twitter.com/Transition)\

abstract: Spreadsheets files are great for sharing data. Spreadsheet applications
  can be a nightmare. In this updated talk, you'll see how OpenPyXL let's you work
  with those files in a way that's better than using the app OR a .csv. I'll also
  discuss common problems in working with spreadsheets via code.

Spreadsheet *applications* are OFTEN terrible. But spreadsheet *files* are everywhere! As one of the default forms of data exchange, learning to work with spreadsheet files directly via Python can save time and effort. We'll look at [Openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/default/), a library that lets you do just that. We'll look at at two different example cases: transforming one spreadsheet into another spreadsheet and converting a spreadsheet into JSON. These two examples will showcase how you can automate what had previously been manual tasks.

I'll also use my experience as a former accountant to highlight some of the issues around reading from and writing to a spreadsheet file and how you might deal with them. 

New and experienced developers will get a potential new use case for Python, which can be used across a wide variety of situations. You MAY even learn to make new friends and grow the Python community! True Story!
