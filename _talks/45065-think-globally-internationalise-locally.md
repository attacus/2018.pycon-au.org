Your software has become successful beyond your wildest dreams. Every single person in your country uses it. The only avenue for growth is the people who don't live in your country. It's time to:

- work out where your users are,
- hire some translators,
- reformat your dates, times, and numbers,
- accept more currencies,
- make sure your designs look good when read right to left, 
- and many other tasks big and small.

If you don't know how to do any of that - or didn't know those tasks needed doing - don't worry. I'm here to walk you through the issues and tell you about the solutions.
