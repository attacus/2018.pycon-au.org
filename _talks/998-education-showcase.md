Python is both a simple and consistent language for beginners and a powerful real-world language used in industry. This combination is why it’s a popular language in education: it’s a great way to start for beginner programmers who are beyond graphical programming environments like Scratch and reaching the limitations of ‘toy’ languages.

The Python in Education seminar aims to bring together Python educators to share ideas and resources. Come along to hear how Python is used to teach programming in school classrooms and extracurricular clubs and camps around Australia. This is a time to share resources and experiences and to bring up any setbacks to a group of people keen and ready to help out.

If you’re new to Python, this is a great opportunity to see what it can do, how it works in an educational environment and build up your own skills and confidence.
