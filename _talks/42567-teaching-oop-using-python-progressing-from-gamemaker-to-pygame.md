abstract: Teaching students Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) is challenging but invaluable.
  Due to its abstract nature, OOP is best taught in a fun and practical context such
  as game design. This talk will examine the progression of teaching OOP using the
  drag-and-drop interface of Game Maker to using Pygame.

Pygame is a fantastic way of teaching senior students OOP using Python. This talk will look at the learning progression used to prepare students for using Pygame; and how Pygame can be used as a senior assessment instrument. The talk will seek to answer the following questions:
1. Why is OOP important for high school students?
2. What are the challenges in teaching OOP?
3. Why is game design perfect for teaching OOP?
4. What is GameMaker and how can it teach OOP? (Demonstration)
5. What is Pygame and how can it teach OOP? (Demonstration)
