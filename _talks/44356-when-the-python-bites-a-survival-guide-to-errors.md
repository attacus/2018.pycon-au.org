  day.

  I''m talking about Errors in Python. Why do they exist? Do we really need them?
  And how do we deal with them instead of panicking when they appear?'

For an experienced programmer, Python does an exceptional job at describing errors, but in the eyes of a beginner, they're completely new and understandably scary.

Come along and gain a better understanding of errors! We'll talk about their history of errors and why they exist, how to read Python errors, and the basics of handling and making them.
