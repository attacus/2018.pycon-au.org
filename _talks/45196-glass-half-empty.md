abstract: 'Django is a robust framework by design, and embodies many good security
  practices. But why and how do Django sites get hacked anyway? What can we do about
  it? And why are astronauts involved?


  Come and learn how pessimism can be optimistic, complexity can be simple, and fear
  can be a friend.'
