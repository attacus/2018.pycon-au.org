abstract: Making a prototype for a new "smart" product but don't have the time, resources
  or data to build out a full machine learning workflow? Never fear, because you can
  usually approximate good algorithms with easy ones. In this talk, I'll guide you
  through approximating (faking) data science with Python.

Data science is transforming the world, with substantial advancements in a wide range of industries. New products are appearing all the time, but you might be thinking "I could never build it - I don't have the data mining skills!". Never fear, because there is a wide range of simple algorithms and techniques that you can use to get you a good model, quickly and with little data. From here, you can then move onto other components of your project without getting bogged down in model development.

In this talk, I'll use simple algorithms and workflows from Pandas, scikit-learn and the standard library. The methods are repeatable, and you might be able to simply steal my code for your next prototype.
