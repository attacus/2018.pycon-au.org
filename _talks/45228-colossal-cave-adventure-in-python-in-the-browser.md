abstract: 'Learn about 36-bit integers and writing interpreters in Python!


  Colossal Cave (Adventure) is the original text adventure, written in FORTRAN IV.
  We explore using software archeology to write a Python interpreter for FORTRAN.  We
  use BeeWare''s Batavia JS Python interpreter to run in the browser.'

Colossal Cave, also known as Adventure or ADVENT, is the original text adventure. It was written in FORTRAN IV and there is practically no way to run the original program without translating it. We'll explore software archeology to write a Python interpreter to run the FORTRAN code as-is, without translating it. Come learn about pre-ASCII and 36-bit integers and writing interpreters in Python!

And, we'll show how to use BeeWare's Batavia Python interpreter (in JavaScript) to execute the program. FORTRAN IV in Python in JavaScript in your browser!
