abstract: The diversity and complexity of the systems for relatively cheap and powerful
  humanoid and animal-like robots can only slow down the development of robotics and
  there is a need for a standard which could be universal, powerful and easy to implement.

The development of relatively cheap and powerful humanoid and animal-like robots has been accompanied by the development of a variety of software, libraries and other interfaces to control the robots. The diversity and complexity of these interfaces can only slow down the development of robotics and there is a need for a standard which could be universal, powerful and easy to implement. 

What are the main needs and architecture for such a standard? How can the knowledge about any programming language help you to talk to a robot?
