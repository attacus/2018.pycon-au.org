abstract: 'How can we fit teaching coding into an already crowded curriculum?

  Make it part of other subjects!  Find out how Python can go beyond the ICT room
  and be used for creative writing, geography, science, maths, art and more.  Example
  projects, games and tips for upper primary to middle school.'

Every aspect of our lives is being changed by computing, so why should learning to code be a separate subject? 
Find out how Python can be used to teach topics  from the more obvious maths and science, to humanities, art, and even outdoor activity.  Yes, Python can be fun!  I'll give examples of projects (and games) in different learning areas with tips on how to engage students as well as information on the Python libraries and other resources needed, including any relevant physical devices.
