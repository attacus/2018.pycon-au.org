Whether it's your first PyCon AU, or your fifth, come along to this introduction session on how to conference successfully. 
 
What is a hallway track?

How can I get the most out of my time at the conference? 

Speakers are scary, can I talk to them? (Spoiler: speakers aren't scary, go say hi!) 

All these questions and more will be answered. 

This session will be lead by first-timer Kojo Idrissa (who runs a similar introductory session at DjangoCon US), and old-hand and familiar face at PyCon AU Russell Keith-Magee.
