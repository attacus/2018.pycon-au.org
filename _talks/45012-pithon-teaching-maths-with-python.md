- bio: 'I''m a recently graduated software developer/applied mathematician. My job
    mostly involves working with C#, but I enjoy sitting down to write some Python
    on my weekends. In the past, I''ve tutored high-school and university students
    in both computer science and mathematics, and I''m passionate about education
    and outreach. '

abstract: Mathematics and programming often go hand in hand, but aren't always equally
  loved by students. I believe that not only can Python be a fantastic tool for teaching
  mathematical concepts, but also that mathematical inquiry can be a starting point
  for developing a wider interest in programming.

Maths and programming are both areas of study which are often considered difficult, or met with some level of stigma within schools. Hopefully by using each to compliment the other, it doesn't always have to be this way!

Throughout this talk, I'll walk through demonstrations of how programming can be used to teach some common mathematical concepts, and why Python is such a great tool for the job! Some examples to explore are:

- Set theory
- Linear algebra
- Combinatorics
- Probability and statistics
- Simulation and modelling
- Data visualisation

I'll also share some of my thoughts on the way in which we go about presenting these topics to students, how to encourage inquisition and experimentation, but also how to set expectations and manage difficulty levels.
