<span class="abstract">We are thrilled to announce our first Invited Speaker for PyCon AU 2018 - Tracy Osborn!</span>
<hr>

<p>Author of <a href="https://hellowebbooks.com/">Hello Web Books</a>, Tracy is no stranger to PyCons around the world, and will be making her way to her first PyCon AU in August to give a presentation entitled: "Clueless".</p>

<blockquote> 
Tracy Osborn is the author, designer, and self-publisher of three books and the
solo founder of a venture-backed startup. Each of these achievements has
something in common â€” being completely clueless about the work and problems
involved in each. In this keynote, Tracy will tell stories about how she
launched her projects and what she learned (after already being neck-deep.)

<p>Tickets for PyCon AU will go on sale soon, with a limited number of Early Bird tickets being made available.
