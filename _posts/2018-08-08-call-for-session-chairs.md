Want to meet some of our amazing speakers, and introduce them before their talk? 

We are calling on PyCon AU attendees to nominate themselves to be session chairs

As a session chair, you will: 

What's involved in being a session chair?

 * Introducing three delightful speakers in a series of talks in a room
 * Holding up time cards to let the speakers know they have 5, 2, 1 minute remaining
 * Helping facilitate Q&A, if the speaker wants questions after their talk

Full details will be provided in training on the day. 

We're looking for 16 session chairs, for four tracks across two days.
