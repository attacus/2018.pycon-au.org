<span class="abstract">We are thrilled to announce our second Invited Speaker for PyCon AU 2018 - Tom Eastman!</span>
<hr>
Tom Eastman has been a serial (perhaps incorrigible) speaker at PyCon AU, having presented nine talks since 2013, with topics ranging from secure web infrastructure best-practices, to YAML and XML parser worst-practices, and to steganographic md5sum-collision generating *mal*-practices.
<br><br>
Tom is a senior software systems engineer at Koordinates, Python programmer, systems geek, and overthinker. He will be presenting a talk on how we learn to get better at our craft, and also how we -- all too easily -- do the opposite.

<br><br>
Conference Director Katie McLaughlin said, "Well, I mean, we were going to have trouble keeping him away, so we figured we'd better just give him the biggest room on purpose".

<br><br>
When asked to clarify her comments, Ms McLaughlin said, "In all seriousness, I’ve been an avid fan of Tom’s since I first saw him speak in 2013, which I later found out was one of his first ever conference presentations. I'm always excited to see him present, so inviting him to keynote PyCon AU 2018 was an easy decision."
