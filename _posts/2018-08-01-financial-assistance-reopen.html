<p>
When buying a ticket for PyCon AU, attendees have the option of paying a bit extra to help someone else make it to PyCon AU. Thanks to a number of generous people, we are now able to open financial assistance applications again.
</p>
<p>
Unforunately for this second round, it's too close to the conference to organise visas and long-distance travel. We will be granting financial assistance requests only for free tickets and travel assistance from within Australia and nearby countries. We still expect you to tell us a bit about why you need assistance, and we'll be assessing each case individually.
</p>
<p>
Please fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SF-MlYH83URal91IPwyCSzfvshXZ6DxvGLXtBx041hc/edit">financial assistance application form</a> to request a free ticket or travel and accommodation expenses and we'll get back to you within a few days.
</p>

<p>If you have the funds, don't forget that <a href="https://2018.pycon-au.org/attend/tickets">tickets for PyCon AU</a> are still on sale! You still have the option of adding a bit extra to our financial assistance pool to help someone else.❤️
