title: On-site Child Care
---

Being inclusive is a core part of the PyCon AU conference culture and to that end we are happy to announce that childcare will be available onsite at PyCon AU 2018 for the Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the main conference. This is for all ages of children up to around 12 years old, and covers the schedule from 9am-5pm.

The child care will be held on-site in a dedicated space at the ICC, one level up from the general conference. Child Care will be provided by [Abracadabra Childcare Services](http://abrachild.com.au/)

We're offering this service at the heavily discounted rate of $30 per child per day. If that cost is problematic for you let us know and we can work something out.

To sign up for child care, please: 
 * go to the [Tickets Page](/attend/tickets) and purchase the appropriate amount of childcare tickets (one per child, per day), *and then also*
 * fill out [this Child Care Details form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pSLyqz0CULP7iDSwV-seynE8ACTfDUycoDVpq1Bev4A) to give us details about the children attending child care.

Child care places are limited and will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis.

We will be closing registrations for child care at the same time as our general ticket sales: 11:59pm Sunday August 19, AEST (Sydney Time). 

If you have any issues, queries, or concerns, please [get in contact with the organisers](/contact).
