        Python has been our language of choice for over 6 years - in that time we've
        deployed Python code for clients including VicRoads, Qantas, Myer, Coles,
        Telstra, BOC, State and Federal Government departments and many others. We have
        active projects using Django, Twisted, Celery, Channels, Pandas and many other
        open source tools from the Python community, so we’re very happy to have this
        opportunity to make a small contribution in return.

      blurb: | 
        We began in 1993 as a small Australian tech start-up. Now we're
        a global team of over 1,800 people across five continents - and we're still
        growing. We're listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, with a strong
        financial track record and our continuous investment in product development and
        innovation is what keeps us ahead of the game.
        <br><br>
        We design, develop and deliver solutions that help with life's big decisions -
        from getting a mortgage, planning for retirement, to trading on the stock
        exchange - things that make a real difference to people's lives and financial
        well-being. We may be one of the largest financial software providers, but we
        haven't forgotten our roots; we've kept the entrepreneurial spirit and agility
        that defined our early years - it's something we continue to look for and
        admire in our people.
        <br><br>
        With offices across Australia, the UK, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and
        Singapore, our team might span the world but we unite to deliver a shared
        vision - to help our clients keep their promises by providing the very best
        that fintech has to offer.
        <br><br>
        We are constantly looking for talented Python developers - the language is used
        by all development teams and is the primary development language used on our
        core product XPLAN.
